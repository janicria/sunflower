# Sunflower changelog

## Development 05
##### TSS, debug macros & better double faults 27/9/25

- Added a much needed TSS to prevent stack overflows from triple faulting
- Made an actually responsible double fault handler that doesn't just call rbod
- Added the `cargo run_debug` command for easier debugging (and also `dbg_info!` and `warn!` macros)
- Fixed some typos in SysCmd 7
- Improved the system info section in rbod and SysCmd 1
- Renamed `LoadDescriptorError`to `LoadRegisterError` since the TSS now uses it
- Prevented `vga::swap_buffers` from accidentally still using the stack, causing stack overflows when called
- Enabled the very import `yeet_expr` feature 
- Fixed some rare cases where the Topbar would be hidden
- Updated rust version to accommodate for `target-pointer-width` becoming an integer in `bootloader`

## Development 04
##### GDT & Topbar 20/9/25

- Sunflower now loads it's own GDT!!
- Added the topbar & help syscmd (SysCmd 7)
- Added the `LoadDescriptorError` wrapper for easier IDT & GDT errors
- Made the rbod border prettier
- Updated screenshots
- Gave `print!` and `println!` color options, to replace `print_color`
- Moved the version from the manifest file to sysinfo

## Development 03
##### Wrappers, better RTC & SysCmd 6 19/9/25

- Added the `InitLater` & `UnsafeFlag` wrapper types
- Replaced some static muts with safe counterparts
- Added RTC time sync error codes via new startup task
- Added a new system command - SysCmd 6
- Created some VGA cursor helper functions for some reason
- Moved `SYS_INIT` into many smaller `X_INIT` statics and added them to SysCmd 1
- Added clippy command which avoids compile error (cargo paperclip)
- Patched a bug where holding shift or SysRq when launching sunflower in a VM would causes the key to become stuck in the opposite state
